about=This plugin supports multi-core processing for running a union process on multiple vector layers. It is many times faster than a single-core union. All layers get merged into a single layer and divided into seperate tiles. A union is run on each tile with multiple union processes running on seperate cores and as the filne step, all tiles are merged again via another union.
